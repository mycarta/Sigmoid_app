# Sigmoid_app
Initial prototype for an interactive app to make sigmoid grayscale colormaps.

It goes together with [this chapter](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things/blob/master/chapters/Niccoli_1.md) in the book (in progress) [52 Things You Should Know About Geocomputing](https://github.com/softwareunderground/52things).

__NB: it is currently optimized to work in Jupyter Notebook, it will not work with JupyterLab__

- All notebooks now running in Python 3 (fixed `print` statements and list generated by `zip`)
- The call to `interact` is up to date with latest version of `ipywidget`
