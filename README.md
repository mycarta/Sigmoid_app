# Sigmoid_app
Prototype for an interactive colormap web app.

__NB: it is currently optimized to work in Jupyter Notebook, it will not work with JupyterLab__

- All notebooks now running in Python 3 (fixed `print` statements and list generated by `zip`)
- The call to `interact` is up to date with latest version of `ipywidget`
